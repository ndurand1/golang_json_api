This is a simple RESTful JSON API that implements a todo list. It has handlers for "/" "/todos" and "todos/{todoID}" for specific items in the list. It handles XSS by escaping special characters before rendering HTML. Will continue this tomorrow going to bed now. 

**TODO** add logging, improve handlers, implement database, create POST route
